Hello, my name is Lucius. This is one of my first larger projects of which is plan to add a few more features, however this was never meant for actual use in a large discord server. Perhaps in the future I will tweak it for such functions but currently its just for learning coding. 
I also have a youtube channel if you want to go and subscribe https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9ThRewmidHy0fyzIX_VKg 
# Discord Bot
This Discord bot uses Openai's API to allow you to use AI in your messages, such as asking it a question and having it respond in one app. 
# Features

- AI prompt feature, give the bot a prompt and it will respond using the !prompt command
 
- Your historical questions will be saved until the bot is restarted or you clear your history with the !clear command

- A session feature to start sessions for any need you need, such as studying or just as a timer.
- Your session will also end after X amount of minutes which allows you to remind yourself
